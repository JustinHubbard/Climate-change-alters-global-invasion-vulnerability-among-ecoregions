# Climate-change-alters-global-invasion-vulnerability-among-ecoregions

R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) was used for all analyses and figure production.

R scripts 1-4 compile the climate and ecoregion data. Script 4 runs the climate matches between ecoregions.
The remaining scripts (6-8 run the analysis and produce all of the figures). 

Data
All data was previously published and is publicly available. Raw files are not shared here to save space for submission, 
with the intention of being shared openly upon publication.

Climate data is accessible from:
Historical period:https://worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html
Future projections: https://worldclim.org/data/cmip6/cmip6climate.html

Ecoregion data is available from:
Freshwater: https://www.feow.org/download
Terrestrial: https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world

The empirically validated climate matching algorithm 'CLIMATE' (Pheloung 1996). 

The climate matching data has filenames begining with "climatch" and is in an .Rda format and can be opened in R. "climatch.aa" represents climatch data for the freshwater ecoregions and "climatch.ta" is for terrestrial ecoregions.
